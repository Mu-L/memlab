# Getting Started

Let's walk through the steps about how you can start using MemLab

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebook/our-repo-url-goes-here.git # clones the repo
cd our-repo-url-goes-here && memlab build-core
```
> `memlab build-core` installs all the dependencies and builds packages. No need to run `yarn`.

## Create E2E test scenario ðŸš§
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.


## Run MemLab
From the repo's root directory, you can now run following:

`memlab run --app=app-name --interaction=your-interaction-name`
